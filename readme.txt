model of a Boolean function (!x1 + x3)x2 + x2x4 based on a single-layer neural network (with a single neuron) with binary inputs x1, x2, x3, x4 = (0,1), a single bias input equal to 1, synaptic weights w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, binary output y={0.1} and a given nonlinear activation function (0,1). For a given Boolean function, training is implemented using all combinations of variables x and part of their possible combinations.
